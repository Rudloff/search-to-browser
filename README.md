# Search to browser

This app forwards `GLOBAL_SEARCH` intents to your default browser.

This can be useful if you are using the Quickstep launcher
without Play Services.
The launcher contains a search bar but very few app
(except for the proprietary Google app) support
the intent this search bar sends.
So this app allows the search bar to launch a search in your browser
instead of doing nothing.
